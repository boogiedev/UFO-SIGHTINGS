## Basic Overview

### Context

It's a bird... it's a plane...it's... a U.F.O. sighting? Over the course of human history U.F.O. sightings seem to be commonplace; commonly described as "flying saucers", strange lights and objects or straight up "Aliens". There are a lot of unknowns that surround the idea of unidentified flying objects, but one thing that is known, are that people are continually fascinated by them. Today, we are looking at reported U.F.O. sightings from ![THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER](http://www.nuforc.org/).
